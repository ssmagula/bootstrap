This is the initial iteration of a concept for a marketing site for Stormpulse. Right now, it covers just the top part of the home page. It features a responsive navbar, and other content (thanks to Bootstrap 3), some open source custom streaming fonts (thanks to the League of Moveable Type and Adobe), icons (thanks to FontAwesome), and some placeholder marketing text and images (thanks to everyone in the office).
